this is a collection of small tools that fit a very specific purpose. given they are probably created in less than a day, they are probably buggy, unfinished and horribly documented. but check for yourself, just click the folder
# file-tree-visualization
the problem: get a file tree in some fancy formats, specifically looking at Obsidian as a target platform 

the solution: python os.walk() wrapper that formats for mermaid.js, linked markdown and other things, so you can have a good map view

# trackextract
the problem: OBS brings a lot for audio configuration pipeline but cannot save as audio file, so there was a need to extract audio from video files

the solution: a batch file that uses ffmpeg to extract audio tracks on the spot (literally drag&drop if configured properly, otherwise a very simple script)
